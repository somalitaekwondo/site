At the end Israel scored 3 points with a head kick and started defending, finishing the fight 7x6 for Israel.</p>		
                <p>“This tournament was to prepare the Somali National Team to fight the World Championship in July – Puebla Mexico. We are going to make some correction but the result itself was really good and we are learning more and more. In the world of taekwondo, no one knows Somalia, but we arrive there and we are getting respect from every opponent. We are not easy to beat and we might be the big surprise in July” said the Somali coach Elton de Souza.</p>

                <p>Before the World Taekwondo Championship the Somali Taekwondo National Team has one more high level tournament in a week (08 and 09 June) in Switzerland (Swiss Open 2013).
